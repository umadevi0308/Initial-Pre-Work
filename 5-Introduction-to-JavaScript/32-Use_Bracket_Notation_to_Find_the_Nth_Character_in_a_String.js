//We can use the bracket notation to find the Nth character in a string. This lesson shows how to find the third letter.// Example
var firstName = "Ada";
var secondLetterOfFirstName = firstName[1];

// Setup
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line.
var thirdLetterOfLastName = lastName[2];
