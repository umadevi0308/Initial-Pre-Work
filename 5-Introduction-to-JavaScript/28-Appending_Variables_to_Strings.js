//This lesson shows how to  build a string over multiple lines. we can also append variables to a string using the plus equals (+=) operator.
// Example
var anAdjective = "awesome!";
var ourStr = "freeCodeCamp is ";
ourStr += anAdjective;

// Only change code below this line

var someAdjective = "good";
var myStr = "Learning to code is ";
myStr +=someAdjective;
