//We can also use the += operator to concatenate a string onto the end of an existing string variable. This can be very helpful to break a long string over several lines.
// Example
var ourStr = "I come first. ";
ourStr += "I come second.";

// Only change code below this line

var myStr = "This is the first sentence. "
myStr += "This is the second sentence."
