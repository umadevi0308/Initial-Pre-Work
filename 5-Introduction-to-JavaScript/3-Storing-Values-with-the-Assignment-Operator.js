//This lesson tells us how to store values with the assignment. Assignment always goes from right to left. Everything to the right of the = operator is resolved before the value is assigned to the variable to the left of the operator.
// Setup
var a;
var b = 2;

// Only change code below this line
var a = 7;
var b = a;
