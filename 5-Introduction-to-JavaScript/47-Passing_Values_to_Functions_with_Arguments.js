/*Parameters are variables that act as placeholders for the values that are to be input to a function when it is called.
 When a function is defined, it is typically defined along with one or more parameters.
The actual values that are input (or "passed") into a function when it is called are known as arguments*/
// Example
function ourFunctionWithArgs(a, b) {
  console.log(a - b);
}
ourFunctionWithArgs(10, 5); // Outputs 5

// Only change code below this line.
function functionWithArgs(a, b) {
  console.log(a + b);
}
functionWithArgs(10, 5);
