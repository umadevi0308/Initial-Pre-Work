// This lesson tells us about For loop. For loop don't have to iterate one at a time. By changing our final-expression, we can count by even numbers.
// Example
var ourArray = [];

for (var i = 0; i < 10; i += 2) {
  ourArray.push(i);
}

// Setup
var myArray = [];

// Only change code below this line.
var myArray = [];
for (var i = 1; i < 10; i +=2){
  myArray.push(i);
}
